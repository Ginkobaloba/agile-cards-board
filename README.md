# agile-cards-board

Web dashboard for the [`agile-cards`](https://github.com/Ginkobaloba/agile-cards)
skill. A drag-drop kanban over a filesystem-backed card store, with sprint
planning and retros wired in for later.

This is the production-grade companion to the single-file `dashboard/v0/index.html`
prototype that ships inside the parent repo. The v0 page is great for a quick
glance; this one is the daily driver.

## What it is

The `/cards` skill stores work-tracking cards as markdown files on disk under
a `todo/` tree, one file per card, with a status frontmatter field and a
subfolder per status:

```
todo/
  backlog/        -- cards waiting to be claimed
  active/         -- cards an executor is working
  amendments/     -- cards awaiting human review (status: awaiting_amendment_review)
  done/           -- cards whose work merged
  blocked/        -- cards finished but unmerged, or paused on deps
```

This dashboard reads that tree, watches it live, and gives you a real UI to
move cards between columns, inspect their frontmatter and body, and (soon)
plan sprints from the backlog and run retros against the done column.

## Stack

```
backend/    Express + TypeScript + better-sqlite3 + chokidar + SSE
frontend/   React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind + Radix primitives + @dnd-kit + Zustand
```

The card files stay on disk as the source of truth. SQLite holds dashboard
state that doesn't belong in a card: auth tokens, sprint scheduling, retro
history, per-user preferences. If you blow away the SQLite database you lose
the dashboard's own state, but every card is still safe in `todo/`.

## Running locally

You need Node 20+ and npm. Docker is optional; useful for the
all-in-one production-style run.

### Without Docker (dev loop)

```powershell
# 1) Install
cd C:\dev\agile-cards-board\backend
npm install

cd ..\frontend
npm install

# 2) Point the backend at your card store. Default is C:\dev\todo.
$env:CARDS_DIR = "C:\dev\todo"
$env:DB_PATH   = "C:\dev\agile-cards-board\backend\data\board.sqlite"
$env:PORT      = "4070"

# 3) Mint your first auth token
cd ..\backend
npm run create-token -- --label "drew-laptop"
# prints the token. Save it. The backend stores only the hash.

# 4) Run backend
npm run dev
# listens on http://localhost:4070

# 5) In a second terminal, run the frontend dev server
cd ..\frontend
npm run dev
# Vite serves http://localhost:5173 and proxies /api + /events to the backend.
```

Open `http://localhost:5173`, paste your token when prompted, you're in.

### With Docker (single-host production-style)

```powershell
cd C:\dev\agile-cards-board
docker compose up --build
```

That brings up:

- `backend` on port 4070, mounting `C:\dev\todo` read-write and persisting
  SQLite to a named volume.
- `frontend` served as static files by nginx on port 8080, proxying
  `/api` and `/events` through to the backend.

Tokens are created against the running backend container:

```powershell
docker compose exec backend node dist/scripts/create-token.js --label "drew-laptop"
```

## Configuration

Environment variables read by the backend at startup:

| var          | default                                | what it does                                     |
|--------------|----------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `PORT`       | `4070`                                 | HTTP port the backend binds                      |
| `CARDS_DIR`  | `C:\dev\todo`                          | Where the card files live                        |
| `DB_PATH`    | `./data/board.sqlite`                  | SQLite database file                             |
| `CORS_ORIGIN`| `http://localhost:5173`                | Allowed origin for the Vite dev server           |
| `LOG_LEVEL`  | `info`                                 | `error`, `warn`, `info`, `debug`                 |
| `CLAUDE_CLI_PATH` | `claude`                          | Override the `claude` CLI binary path for the planner invoker |

## Submitting a story

The kanban is the read side of the system. The submit-story surface at
`/submit` is the write side.

1. Open `/submit` from the header. Paste a user story in the textarea.
2. Pick a project from the dropdown, or leave it as "(no project)".
3. Optionally open "Advanced options" to force deep (3-agent) planning
   or override the project's mode.
4. Click **Plan this story**. The backend invokes the `/cards` skill in
   a staging directory under `<CARDS_DIR>/_staging/<batchId>/`. Progress
   events stream back over SSE so you can watch the planner and reviewer
   work in real time.
5. When planning finishes, a dry-run review panel appears with the
   proposed cards, tier histogram, depends-on edges, and total estimated
   tokens. Nothing is in the backlog yet.
6. Click **Approve and write to backlog** to promote the staged batch.
   The cards land in `<CARDS_DIR>/backlog/`, the manifest moves to
   `<CARDS_DIR>/_batches/<batchId>/manifest.json`, the chokidar watcher
   fires `card-added` events, and the kanban updates live.
7. Click **Cancel** to discard the staging dir and start over.

The submit endpoint and its companions are bearer-token-gated, same as
the rest of `/api/*`:

- `POST /api/stories/submit` — streams `progress`, `dry_run`, and
  `error` SSE events.
- `POST /api/stories/:batchId/approve` — promotes to backlog.
- `POST /api/stories/:batchId/cancel` — discards the staging dir.
- `GET  /api/stories/pending` — lists in-memory pending batches.

The planner runs as a subprocess (`claude -p` by default). The wire-up
between the dashboard and the runner is documented in
`docs/handoffs/HANDOFF_2026-05-18_submit-story.md`.

## Auth

Bearer tokens, the same scheme as Sprint 3b on brainstem, but with a
separate token store on the dashboard backend for now. No cross-service
state. Token storage: SHA-256 hash + a public label + created/last-used
timestamps. Plaintext is shown exactly once at creation; lose it and you
mint another one.

```powershell
# create
npm run create-token -- --label "iphone"

# list (no plaintext, just labels and timestamps)
npm run list-tokens

# revoke
npm run revoke-token -- --label "iphone"
```

Every request to `/api/*` and `/events` must carry `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
The frontend stores the token in `sessionStorage` so a tab reload keeps you
signed in but closing the tab logs you out. That can be loosened to
`localStorage` later if you want long-lived browser sessions.

## Real-time

The backend watches `CARDS_DIR` with chokidar. When a card file is added,
modified, moved, or removed, the backend rescans the affected file, updates
its in-memory index, and pushes a `card-state-changed` SSE event to every
connected dashboard. The frontend's `useSSE` hook applies the diff in-place;
no full refresh.

That means you can have the dashboard open in two tabs, drag a card in one,
and the other reflects the move within a few hundred milliseconds. It also
means edits made by `/cards` runners on disk show up live.

## Hosting

Long-term home is `projectNexusCode.org` via a Cloudflare tunnel pointing
at `BROOKFIELD_PC:4070`. The tunnel is wired up in a separate step; this
repo just expects to run on whatever port `PORT` says.
